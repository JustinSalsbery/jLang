# overview
& design philosophy

Optionals are superior to null/nill/NaN/undefined/etc.
Class inheritance is too unwieldy. (Far too often abused with enormous inheritance trees.)
Use one flexible syntax pattern rather than many situational syntax patterns.
Offload unnecessary features to libraries. (Actors, for instance.)
I'm unconvinced by functions as first-class citizens/passable. Complexity ramps up too quickly.
I'm uncertain a good model for object initialization. (I feel like common methods either are unsafe (C), annoying, or hide too many details (Java).)
