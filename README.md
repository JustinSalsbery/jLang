# jLang
## j language compiler

See examples/example.j for an example of syntax. 
I think object oriented code provides great organization, but I feel like most object oriented languages these
days are bloated messes of feature creep. 
Conversely, most functional languages are dense, complex, and overly symbolic.

I wanted to design a simple language. Quite frankly I've come away realizing just how many compromises a proper
language needs and with a much greater appreciation for the languages I use.
Now I just want to explore Haskell, Erlang, and Arm Assembly further. 

I'm putting writing my own syntax on the backburner for now. I don't know enough to write my own language... yet. 
And I certainly don't have time currently.
